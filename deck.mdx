### Containers for rest of us 🎤

---
## Definition of Container 🤷

```
Containers are isolated from 
one another and bundle their own software, 
libraries and configuration files
```
---
### You want to know what exactly it is?

<img src={Matrix} />

---
# Step 1

* Forget containers
---
# Step 2

## Let us just try to do the following

* Avoid program from killing another process
* Avoid program from updating my hostname
* Avoid program from reading my secret file

---
### First things First

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
   ...
   fp = fopen("file.txt","r");
   ...
}
```
---
## How it works

---
## What is a Space?

* Abstraction of resources available to a program
* Spaces divided into *namespaces*
* Some of the namespaces are
 - Process ID
 - Mount
 - Interprocess Communication
 - Network (NET)
 - UNIX Time Sharing

---
## Create new namespace

---
## Enough is enough, let us demo

<img src={Tensed} />

---
## Mental Modal

* Unshare command was our container runtime
* Containerd is docker's container runtime (extra edge cases)
* Rootfs management and other tools (docker)

---
## What does this all say?

* Containers are faster than VM because container is just another process running on your OS
* When you download ubuntu or alphine image you are just downloading bin files not the entire OS
* Container image built for one OS cannot run on another (unlike VM) because they use OS specific syscall
* Only Windows and Linux can natively run container, if you are running linux container image in mac you will require a linux VM
